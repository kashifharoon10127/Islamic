JavaScript dynamically loads these details into the HTML structure.
Playback Controls:

Play/Pause: Toggles audio playback and updates the play button icon dynamically.
Next/Previous: Skips to the next or previous Naat in the playlist.
Progress Bar: Updates in real-time as the Naat plays.
Volume Control:

Adjust the playback volume using the volume slider.
Future Improvements 🚀
Add a shuffle feature for random playback.
Integrate a search bar for filtering Naats.
Provide a download option for users.
Enhance the app design with advanced animations.
